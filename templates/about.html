    <p style="margin-left: 40px" >My name is Michael Lesko-Krleza, and I am a Computer Engineering student in Concordia Univeristy. I am entering my fourth year of my studies, and I always wanted to join a fun school club where I could learn more.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">I very much enjoy working in software development, but also enjoy tinkering with hardware. I have already worked on building an RC hovercraft, and a smart dog collar tracked with an Android application. These projects were great fun to me, which brought me interest in joining the Space Concordia Robotics division.</p>
    <h2 style="margin-left: 10px">Thank you, and I hope to get to know you all!</h2>
